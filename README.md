# Cognilace

**Weaving Human and Agent into Symbiotic Intelligence**

Cognilace is an open-source framework for developing collaborative AI systems. It’s built on principles of **symbiotic intelligence** and **collaborative recursive refinement**— where human insight and modular AI agents evolve together in a recursive loop of reflection, adaptation, and improvement.

Unlike traditional agent frameworks that chase autonomy, Cognilace embraces a **human-in-the-loop design**, enabling users to develop their own skills as they guide, refine, and extend agent behavior safely and intentionally.

Whether you're building an intelligent research assistant, a personal pair programmer, or a domain-specific workflow AI, Cognilace offers a powerful foundation for systems that **learn from feedback, adapt over time, and grow with their users**.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Human-Guided Evolution**  
  Collaborate via GitHub-style feedback, prompt refinement, and modular upgrades.

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**  
  Compose swarms of specialized agents with distinct roles and LLMs.

- **Modular Memory & Reasoning**  
  Integrate RAG pipelines with vector + graph memory (Qdrant, Neo4j, etc.).

- **Pluggable Tools & APIs**  
  Expand capabilities safely with tools, plugins, and permissioned access.

- **Self-Hosted or API-Compatible**  
  Run locally with open-source models or integrate API-based LLMs.

- **Cloud-Ready**  
  Deploy to the cloud with secure, scalable infrastructure.

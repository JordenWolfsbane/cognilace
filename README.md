# Cognilace

**Weaving Human and Agent into Symbiotic Intelligence**

Cognilace is an open-source framework for developing collaborative AI systems, built on principles of **symbiotic intelligence**â€” where humans and modular AI agents learn to work as an evolving team.  Unlike AI frameworks which attempt to create general purpose agents, Cognilace is focused on creating a framework for **collaborative recursive evolution**--iteratively improving its own codebase to refine its codebase to exponentially grow its capabilities--the strong AI's holy grail, but also a potential existential threat to humanity. To manage those risks, Cognilace is designed from the ground up always keep a **human-in-the-loop**.  This ensures alignment with ethical values while also leveraging the incredible power of the human brain to accelerate and guide the agents' evolution while the agent encourages its human partner's growth through educating them in AI development and collaboration.  Anyone with a computer and the motivation to learn will be able to deploy an adaptive Cognilace agent ready to immediately begin teaching and evolving to meet that person's needs.  Whether they need an intelligent research assistant, a tutor, a programming assistant, a data analyst, or all of the above--Cognilace will offer a powerful foundation for systems that **learn from feedback, adapt over time, and grow with their users**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Cognilace will be a seed repository yielding a garden of symbiotic intelligences--agents evolving into not just assistants but extensions of the human mind. This is not just a framework--it is a revolution with the potential to counter the dangerous trend of concentrating AIs power in the hands of the few who want to remove most humans from the equation. The creation of the first superintelligence is inevitable, and humanity needs it in the hands of the people rather than just serving only those with hundreds of billions to invest or--perhaps even worse--grow its own power and independence. A thriving Cognilace community is a democratic challenge to that dangerous AI hegemony--a framework for growing a community of Human-Machine intelligences which are much more than the sum of their parts.
